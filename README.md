# Avaiation Edge .NET SDK
A super quick and dirty client library for AviationEdge 

I keep messing about with creating tools for Flight Simulator 2020 and wanted to try out the data from [Aviation Edge](https://aviation-edge.com/).

The code exists but its untested. Do expect lots of issues. I'll fix them / update as I start to consume this library.
